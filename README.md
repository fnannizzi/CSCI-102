CS102-Game
==========

Game created for Professor Tejada&#39;s CS102 class at USC

Hello! This is a game I programmed for my CS102 class at USC. It still has some bugs, but restarting the game will "fix" most of them. 

To shoot missiles, hit the spacebar.
To move left and right, use the left and right arrow keys.
To level up, hit the H key. (Note: This is a cheat. It was useful when demoing my game to TAs.)
To pause, hit P.
To quit, hit escape.

Have fun!
